  <h1><b><u>Experiment 1:Reaction Time</u></b></h1>
  <p><b>Description:</b><i>This experiment measures how quickly individuals can respond to various stimuli.</i></p>
  <p><b>Objective:</b><i>To access how reaction times vary under different conditions(e.g., noise levels,time of day).</i></p>
  <p><b>Methodology</b><i>Participants were tested with visual and auditory stimuli at different times and under various conditions. Their response times were recorded. </i></p>
  <p><b>Results:</b><i>Results showed that reaction times were slower in noisy environments compared to quiet ones.Additionally,performance improved with practice.</i></p>
